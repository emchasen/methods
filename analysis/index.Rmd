The goal of this work was to create a model to predict pasture yield to help farmers . This model needed to be sensitive to inherent site properties such as soil as well as to management practices. 

In order to accomplish this, we used data from the SSURGO database [USDA Web Soil Survey](https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/HomePage.htm) to predict pasture yield potential based on soil properties and grass species.
